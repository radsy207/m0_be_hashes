# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
Finding the command to print specific values and keys of a certain order. Then also took me a bit to figure out how to insert them in a string.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
It is helpful for me to add all the definitions to one page, then examples of the code on the same page.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I try on my own first before heading to google.
